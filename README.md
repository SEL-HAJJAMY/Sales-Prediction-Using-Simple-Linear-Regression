Sales Prediction (Simple Linear Regression)

Problem Statement
Build a model which predicts sales based on the money spent on different platforms for marketing.

Data
Use the advertising dataset and analyse the relationship between 'TV advertising' and 'Ventes' using a simple linear regression model.

In this project, we'll build a linear regression model to predict 'Ventes' using an appropriate predictor variable.
